## üÜï NEW TICKET: Real-Time Multi-PC Synchronization

## Ticket 12: Adaptive Refresh for Multi-PC Deployments ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** High (Enterprise multi-PC deployment critical)

**Description:**
Implement adaptive refresh rates to enable real-time synchronization of acknowledgments across multiple PCs accessing shared storage (Google Drive, network drives, etc.).

**Problem Solved:**
- Previously: All PCs refreshed acknowledgments every 30 seconds, causing up to 30-second delays before other users saw acknowledgments
- Solution: Dynamic refresh timing based on alert status for immediate multi-PC synchronization

**Implementation:**
1. **Adaptive Refresh Timing:**
   - **Fast Mode (5 seconds)**: During active/missed alerts for real-time sync
   - **Normal Mode (30 seconds)**: When no alerts active to preserve system resources
   - Automatic switching based on current alert status

2. **File Change Detection:**
   - Monitor `acknowledgments.json` modification timestamp
   - Detect changes made by other PCs accessing shared storage
   - Rebuild manifest list only when external changes detected
   - Silent failure handling to maintain system stability

3. **Immediate Response Triggers:**
   - When user acknowledges a manifest, immediately switch to fast refresh mode
   - Other PCs detect changes within 5 seconds instead of up to 30 seconds
   - Automatic return to normal refresh when alerts resolved

**Multi-PC Deployment Benefits:**
- **Real-Time Updates**: User acknowledgments appear on all PCs within 5-10 seconds
- **Resource Efficient**: Normal 30-second refresh when no alerts active
- **Enterprise Ready**: Supports Google Drive Desktop, network drives, shared folders
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic detection of shared storage scenarios

**Technical Details:**
- `update_refresh_timing()`: Dynamically adjusts timer intervals
- `check_acknowledgment_changes()`: File modification monitoring
- Preserves all existing functionality while adding multi-PC awareness
- Compatible with existing Google Drive/network drive deployments

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Real-time multi-PC synchronization implemented and tested.
