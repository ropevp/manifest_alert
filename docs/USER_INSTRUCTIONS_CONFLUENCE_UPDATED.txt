# Manifest Alert System - User Guide

## What This System Does

The **Manifest Alert System** helps warehouse staff stay on top of delivery manifests by providing **visual**, **audio**, and **voice alerts** when manifests are due or overdue. It runs on your computer screen and automatically tracks manifest times throughout the day.

## Main Display

### 🕐 Clock & Status
* **Large digital clock** shows current time
* **Blue countdown** shows "Next: 16:00 in 01:23" for upcoming manifests  
* **Red warning** shows "Manifest Late by 15 mins" when manifests are overdue

### 📋 Manifest List
* **Time groups** (11:00, 12:30, etc.) show all carriers for that time
* **Colors indicate status**:
  * **Blue** = Open (not due yet)
  * **Red Flashing Background** = Active (due now, needs attention)
  * **Dark Red** = Missed (very overdue)

## Alert Types

### 🔴 Visual Alerts
* **Red flashing background** (every 0.7 seconds) when manifests are due
* **White text on red background** for maximum visibility
* **Status messages** at top of screen

### 🔊 Audio Alerts
* **Alert sound** (alert.wav) plays when manifests become due
* **Configurable volume** through system settings

### 🗣️ Voice Announcements
* **Text-to-speech** announces which carriers are due
* **Example**: "Manifest Alert: Australia Post Metro, EParcel Express are due for pickup at 16:00"
* **Automatic retry** if voice engine is busy

## Configuration & Settings

### ⚙️ **Settings Menu**
* Click **"Settings"** button in main window
* Configure where data files are stored
* **Perfect for multi-PC deployment**

### 📁 **Data Storage Options**
* **Default**: Files stored in `app_data/` folder
* **Cloud Storage**: Point to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox
* **Network Drive**: Use shared location for multiple PCs
* **Custom Location**: Choose any accessible folder

### 🔄 **Multi-PC Setup**
* Each PC can point to the same shared data folder
* **Shared files**: `config.json` (manifest schedule), `acknowledgments.json` (activity logs)
* **Local files**: `settings.json` (folder preferences per PC)
* **Perfect for warehouses** with multiple workstations

---

## Files & Folders

### 📂 **Data Files**
* **`config.json`** = Manifest schedule (times and carriers)
* **`acknowledgments.json`** = Activity log (what was acknowledged when)
* **`settings.json`** = User preferences (where to find data files)
* **`config.json.backup`** = Backup of manifest schedule

### 🌐 **Deployment Options**
* **Single PC**: Use default `app_data/` folder
* **Multiple PCs**: Point all to shared network folder
* **Cloud Sync**: Use cloud storage for automatic synchronization
* **Hybrid**: Mix of local and shared storage as needed

## Troubleshooting

### 🔧 **Common Issues**

**No alerts playing?**
* Check system volume
* Verify `alert.wav` file exists in `resources/` folder

**Voice announcements not working?**
* Windows Speech Platform may need restart
* Check Windows Text-to-Speech settings

**App won't start after clean install?**
* App automatically creates missing data files
* Default manifest schedule will be empty (add your times)

**Settings not saving?**
* Check folder permissions
* Ensure chosen folder is writable
* Try "Reset to Default" in Settings dialog

### 📋 **First Time Setup**
1. **Run the application** - it creates default folders automatically
2. **Configure manifest times** - edit `config.json` or use future configuration UI
3. **Set data location** - use Settings dialog if sharing between PCs
4. **Test alerts** - wait for next scheduled time or modify config for immediate testing

## Technical Notes

### 💾 **File Locations**
* **Default data folder**: `app_data/` (next to application)
* **Configurable via Settings**: Can point anywhere
* **Automatic creation**: Missing files and folders created on startup

### 🔄 **Enterprise Deployment**
* **IT-friendly**: Pre-configure `settings.json` to point to shared location
* **No user intervention**: App works immediately after deployment
* **Centralized management**: Update one config file, affects all PCs
* **Audit trail**: All activity logged with timestamps

### 🎯 **Best Practices**
* **Regular backups**: `config.json.backup` is automatically maintained
* **Shared storage**: Use network drives or cloud storage for multi-PC environments
* **Testing**: Modify manifest times to test alerts before go-live
* **Monitoring**: Check `acknowledgments.json` for staff performance insights

### 🛠️ **Regular Maintenance**
* **Monitor disk space** in data folder location
* **Check acknowledgments log** for unusual patterns
* **Update manifest times** seasonally as carrier schedules change
* **Test voice announcements** periodically

### 📞 **Getting Help**
* **Configuration issues**: Check Settings dialog and file permissions
* **Alert problems**: Verify audio files and system volume
* **Multi-PC setup**: Ensure all PCs can access shared folder
* **Performance**: Monitor system resources if running on older hardware
