### Ticket 20: Snooze Window Management Fix ✅
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** Critical (User experience during snooze periods)

**Problem Addressed:** Snoozed alerts still forcing window to remain maximized and always-on-top, preventing normal window management.

**Root Cause:** Window management logic didn't distinguish between active alerts and snoozed alerts.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Smart Alert Detection**: New helper methods for proper snooze handling
   - `has_active_alerts()`: Detects Active/Missed manifests
   - `has_unsnooze_alerts()`: Detects active alerts that are NOT snoozed

2. **Snooze-Aware Window Management**:
   - **During Active Alerts (Not Snoozed)**: Window forced maximized, always-on-top enabled
   - **During Snoozed Alerts**: Always-on-top disabled, window can be minimized/moved
   - **No Alerts**: Normal window behavior

3. **Enhanced Snooze Process**:
   - Automatically removes always-on-top flag when snoozing
   - Stops both audio and voice announcements
   - Updates user message: "Window can now be minimized"
   - Prevents forced window focusing during snooze period

4. **Improved `_bring_to_front()` Method**:
   - Checks snooze status before forcing window to front
   - Returns early if alerts are snoozed
   - Respects user's window management during snooze

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Snoozed Alerts**: Window behaves like normal application - can minimize, move, etc.
- **Active Alerts**: Window still forces attention as required for warehouse safety
- **User Control**: Snooze provides true relief from alert pressure
- **Professional Behavior**: Matches enterprise application standards

### Ticket 21: Voice Announcement Snooze Integration ✅
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** High (Complete snooze functionality)

**Problem Addressed:** Voice announcements ("multiple missed manifests") continued during snooze period despite audio alerts being silenced.

**Root Cause:** Speech timer and voice announcement system didn't check snooze status.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Snooze Check in Voice System**: Added snooze status checking to `speak_active_alert()` method
2. **Speech Timer Management**: 
   - Stop speech timer when snoozing begins
   - Restart speech timer when snooze ends (if alerts still active)
3. **Complete Audio Silence**: Both WAV file alerts and voice announcements respect snooze
4. **Automatic Resume**: When snooze expires, both audio and voice resume if alerts remain

**Technical Implementation:**
- Early return in `speak_active_alert()` if snoozed
- Speech timer stop/start logic in snooze methods  
- Unified snooze checking across audio systems
- Proper cleanup when snooze period ends

**User Benefits:**
- **True Silence**: Complete audio relief during snooze periods
- **Professional Behavior**: No unexpected voice announcements during breaks
