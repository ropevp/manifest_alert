## For New Users (Simplest Method)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
1. Install **Python** from [python.org](https://python.org) - ⚠️ **Check "Add Python to PATH"**
2. Install **Git** from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Step 2: One-Click Installation
1. Create a folder where you want the application (e.g., `C:\ManifestAlerts`)
2. Download `INSTALL.bat` from this repository
3. Put `INSTALL.bat` in your folder
4. Double-click `INSTALL.bat` and follow the prompts

That's it! The installer will:
- Download all application files automatically
- Set up the virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create desktop shortcuts
- Make it ready to use

### Step 3: Updates
**To update later:** Just run the same `INSTALL.bat` file again - it automatically detects existing installations and updates them while preserving your settings.

## For Google drive location: 

Open the Shared Folder in Your Browser: 
Click on the share link you received. 
This will open the folder in the Google Drive web interface.

Add a Shortcut to "My Drive":

In the top right, next to the folder name, click the "Add shortcut to Drive" icon (an icon of a drive with a plus sign).

A window will pop up allowing you to choose where to place the shortcut. Select "My Drive" and click "Add shortcut."

Locate the Folder on Your Computer:

Open your computer's File Explorer.

Navigate to your Google Drive folder. This is typically a drive letter assigned by the Google Drive app (e.g., G:).

Inside your Google Drive, you will find the shortcut you just created, which will open the shared folder. The path will look something like this: G:\My Drive\[Name of the shared folder].
