## üéØ How the Manifest Alert System Works

**System Overview:**
The Manifest Alert System monitors scheduled manifest deliveries and provides visual and audio alerts when manifests become active or missed. The system automatically tracks acknowledgments across multiple computers for warehouse coordination.

### Alert Types

üî¥ **Active Manifests**: Current time matches scheduled time (red background, audio alerts)

üü† **Missed Manifests**: Past due and unacknowledged (orange background, urgent alerts)

üîµ **Open Manifests**: Scheduled but not yet active (blue background)

üü¢ **Acknowledged Manifests**: Completed and marked as handled (green background)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Active and Missed manifests require immediate attention and will continue alerting until acknowledged!

### Window Behavior

**Window Management Features:**
* **Always Visible**: Window stays on screen during alerts for maximum visibility
* **Auto-Sizing**: Automatically adjusts to fit all manifests
* **Monitor Switching**: "Switch Monitor" button cycles through all displays
* **System Tray**: Minimizes to system tray, click to restore

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System (config.json)

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Configurable Storage**: The system supports local, network, and cloud storage via the Settings dialog for multi-PC deployments.

### File Location

The system uses **configurable data storage** via the Settings dialog:

| Storage Type | Path Example | Best For |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Local** | `app_data/config.json` | Single computer installations |
| **Network** | `\\server\share\manifest_data\config.json` | Multi-PC sharing |
| **Cloud** | `G:\My Drive\manifest_data\config.json` | Google Drive Desktop sync |

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "manifests": [
    {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "time": "08:00",
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "carrier": "UPS", 
      "time": "10:30",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

> **üìù JSON Validation**: Always validate your JSON syntax using an online JSON validator before saving changes.

### Configuration Fields

**Required Fields Reference:**
* **carrier**: Display name for the manifest (e.g., "FedEx", "UPS Ground", "Amazon")
* **time**: Scheduled time in 24-hour format (e.g., "08:00", "14:30") 
* **active**: Boolean - set to `false` to temporarily disable a manifest

### Adding/Editing Manifests

**Detailed Configuration Steps:**
1. **Manual Editing**: Edit config.json directly with any text editor
2. **Reload Configuration**: Click "Reload Config" button to apply changes  
3. **Validation**: System validates time format and displays errors if invalid

### Time Format Requirements

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: Use exact 24-hour format with leading zeros to prevent errors!

* **24-Hour Format**: Use "HH:MM" (e.g., "08:00", "14:30", "23:45")
* **Leading Zeros**: Always include leading zeros (e.g., "08:00" not "8:00")
* **Valid Times**: 00:00 to 23:59 only

## Acknowledgment System (acknowledgments.json)

### File Purpose

Tracks which manifests have been acknowledged and by whom. Enables multi-PC coordination and accountability.

### File Location

Same configurable location as config.json:

* **Local**: app_data/acknowledgments.json
* **Shared**: User-configured network or cloud location

### Acknowledgment Structure

```json
[
  {
    "carrier": "FedEx",
    "time": "08:00",
    "acknowledged_by": "John Smith",
    "acknowledged_at": "2025-07-01T08:05:23",
    "reason": "Package delivered to receiving dock"
  }
]
```

### Acknowledgment Fields

* **carrier**: Matches the carrier name from config.json
* **time**: Matches the scheduled time from config.json
* **acknowledged_by**: User's custom name or Windows username
* **acknowledged_at**: Timestamp when acknowledgment was made
* **reason**: User-entered reason for acknowledgment (required)

### Acknowledgment Process

1. **Click Manifest**: Click any manifest entry in the list
2. **Enter Reason**: Type reason for acknowledgment (required field)
3. **Submit**: Click "Acknowledge" to save
4. **Immediate Update**: Manifest turns gray and shows "- Acknowledged - [Your Name]"
5. **Multi-PC Sync**: Other computers see acknowledgment within 0.5-2 seconds

## Timing and Refresh System

### Alert Timing

* **Pre-Alert**: Manifests appear 30 minutes before scheduled time
* **Active Alert**: Audio and visual alerts start at exact scheduled time
* **Missed Alert**: Continues alerting until acknowledged if past due

### Refresh Rates (Adaptive System)

The system uses intelligent refresh timing for optimal performance:

#### Fast Refresh Mode (0.5 seconds)

**Triggers:**
* When any manifest becomes Active (red)
* When any manifest becomes Missed (orange)
* For 60 seconds after user acknowledgments

**Purpose:**
* Real-time multi-PC synchronization during critical periods
* Immediate visibility of acknowledgments across warehouse computers
* Ultra-responsive operation during active alerts

#### Normal Refresh Mode (2 seconds)

**Triggers:**
* When all manifests are Open (blue) or acknowledged
* During idle periods with no active alerts
* System automatically switches from fast mode after alert resolution

**Purpose:**
* Resource-efficient operation during normal hours
* Preserves system performance for long-term 24/7 operation
* Maintains responsiveness while conserving CPU usage

### Multi-PC Synchronization

* **File Monitoring**: System detects changes to acknowledgments.json from other computers
* **Automatic Updates**: UI refreshes immediately when external changes detected
* **Conflict Resolution**: Last acknowledgment wins (no locking mechanism needed)
* **Network Compatibility**: Works with Windows network drives, Google Drive Desktop, and cloud storage

## Audio Alert System

### Voice Announcements

Professional text-to-speech announcements using Windows Zira voice:

#### Announcement Patterns

* *Single Active*: "Manifest at eight thirty"
* *Single Missed*: "Manifest Missed, at eight thirty. Manifest is fifteen minutes Late"
* *Multiple Active*: "Multiple manifests Active. Please acknowledge"
* *Multiple Missed*: "Multiple missed manifests. Please acknowledge"
* *Mixed Status*: "Multiple Missed and Active Manifests. Please acknowledge"

#### Timing Behavior

* *Announcement Interval*: Every 20 seconds during active alerts
* *Smart Logic*: Prevents repetitive announcements with consolidated messages
* *Background Operation*: Non-blocking speech processing
* *Error Recovery*: Silent failure if speech engine unavailable

### Sound Alerts

* *Alert Sound*: Professional alert tone (alert.wav)
* *Timing*: Plays with each voice announcement
* *Volume*: Uses system volume settings
* *File Location*: resources/alert.wav
