*   **Proper Time Pronunciation:** "eleven thirty", "three oh three", "four o'clock"
*   **Status-Specific Messages:**
    *   Single Active: "Manifest at [time]"
    *   Single Missed: "Manifest Missed, at [time]. Manifest is [X] minutes Late"
    *   Multiple Active: "Multiple manifests Active. Please acknowledge"
    *   Multiple Missed: "Multiple missed manifests. Please acknowledge" 
    *   Mixed: "Multiple Missed and Active Manifests. Please acknowledge"

### üñ•Ô∏è **Advanced Window Management**
*   **Smart Display Priority:** Active alerts override Missed for full-screen prominence
*   **Always-on-Top:** Stays above all windows during critical alerts
*   **Multi-Monitor Support:** Seamless cycling between all connected displays
*   **Consistent Behavior:** Window remains maximized after all acknowledgment types
*   **Auto-Maximize:** Automatically maximizes during Active/Missed alerts

### üìä **Visual Status System**
*   **Color-Coded Status Indicators:**
    *   **Open (Blue):** Upcoming manifest (0-15 minutes before due)
    *   **Active (Red):** Currently due manifest (0-29 minutes late)
    *   **Missed (Dark Red):** Overdue manifest (30+ minutes late)
    *   **Acknowledged (Green):** Successfully handled manifests
    *   **Acknowledged Late (Orange):** Late manifests with logged reasons
*   **Real-Time Updates:** 30-second refresh cycle with immediate alert responses
*   **Tree-Style Organization:** Collapsible groups by time with carrier details

### üîä **Multi-Layer Audio System**
*   **Continuous Alert Sound:** Immediate attention-grabbing beep (alert.wav)
*   **Voice Announcements:** Every 20 seconds with professional speech synthesis
*   **Synchronized Audio:** Both systems work harmoniously without conflicts
*   **Snooze Support:** Complete audio silence during snooze periods

### üìù **Comprehensive Logging & Tracking**
*   **Complete Audit Trail:** All acknowledgments logged with timestamps
*   **Reason Tracking:** Mandatory reason entry for missed manifests
*   **JSON Format:** Human-readable logs in `logs/acknowledgments.json`
*   **Data Validation:** Error recovery for corrupted log files
*   **Daily Reset:** Automatic midnight rollover with data preservation

### üõ†Ô∏è **System Tray Integration**
*   **Minimal Footprint:** Lives in system tray when not alerting
*   **Quick Access Menu:** Show/Hide window, Exit application
*   **Professional Icon:** Clear visibility in system tray area
*   **Warehouse-Optimized:** No accidental closing, always accessible

### ‚è∞ **Advanced Scheduling**
*   **Flexible Configuration:** JSON-based manifest time and carrier setup
*   **Day-Change Logic:** Automatic reset at midnight without restart
*   **Timezone Aware:** Proper handling of date boundaries
*   **Config Reload:** Live configuration updates without application restart

### üîß **Robust Error Handling**
*   **Speech Failure Recovery:** Visual alerts continue if voice fails
*   **File Corruption Protection:** Automatic backup and recovery
*   **Network Resilience:** Graceful handling of resource unavailability  
*   **Silent Failures:** Non-critical errors don't disrupt operation
