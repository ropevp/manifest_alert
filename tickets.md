## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXES

### Ticket 9: Window Management Stability ✅
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** Critical (Production reliability)

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Window Minimization Bug**: Application minimizing during color changes and acknowledgments
2. **Alert Priority Logic**: Incorrect priority order causing Missed alerts to hide Active alerts
3. **Inconsistent Window State**: Window state not preserved across acknowledgment operations

- Redundant `show()` calls after `setWindowFlag()` operations
- Priority order "Missed > Active > Open" instead of correct "Active > Missed > Open"
- Missing window state preservation in acknowledgment methods

**Solutions Applied:**
- Removed all redundant window visibility calls after flag changes
- Corrected alert priority logic for proper full-screen prominence
- Added consistent window state management across all acknowledgment paths
- Implemented proper window maximization preservation

**Testing Results:**
- Zero unwanted minimization during 24-hour test periods
