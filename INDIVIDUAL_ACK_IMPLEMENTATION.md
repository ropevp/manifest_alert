# Individual Manifest Acknowledgment Labels

## Overview
This implementation adds individual acknowledgment labels for each manifest carrier line, replacing the previous single acknowledgment display for entire time groups.

## Key Changes

### 1. Layout Modifications
- **StatusCard.setup_ui()**: Modified to create individual acknowledgment section (650px wide)
- **StatusCard.update_manifest_display()**: Now creates acknowledgment labels for each carrier
- **Individual alignment**: Each carrier has its own acknowledgment label, vertically aligned

### 2. Visual Improvements
- **Font sizes**: Carriers (22px), Acknowledgments (18px - slightly smaller as requested)
- **Width**: Acknowledgment section is exactly 650px as specified
- **Single line**: Text doesn't wrap, fits on one line
- **Color coding**: Green for "Done", Orange for "Done Late"

### 3. Data Integration
- **Existing ack.json structure**: No changes needed, already supports individual tracking
- **Key format**: `{date}_{manifest_time}_{carrier}` for individual lookup
- **Timestamp formatting**: Shows acknowledgment time in HH:MM format

## Before vs After

### Before (Previous Implementation)
```
| 11:02 - DONE  | AUP International for NZ    | Done by Rohan at 12:21 |
|               | Australia Post Metro        |                        |
|               | EParcel Postplus            |                        |
```
**Issues**: Single acknowledgment for entire time group, not aligned with individual carriers

### After (New Implementation) 
```
| 11:02 - DONE  | AUP International for NZ    | Done by john.doe at 10:05        |
|               | Australia Post Metro        | Done Late by jane.smith at 10:35 |
|               | EParcel Postplus            | (not acknowledged)               |
```
**Benefits**: âœ“ Individual per carrier âœ“ Vertically aligned âœ“ 650px wide âœ“ Single line âœ“ Color coded

## Technical Details

### Modified Methods
1. `StatusCard.setup_ui()` - Layout changes for individual acknowledgments
2. `StatusCard.update_manifest_display()` - Creates individual acknowledgment labels
3. `StatusCard.get_acknowledgments_for_time_slot()` - New method for carrier-specific acknowledgment lookup
4. `StatusCard.update_card_status()` - Simplified, removed overall acknowledgment logic

### Removed Methods
- `StatusCard.set_acknowledgment()` - No longer needed with individual labels

### Layout Structure
```
HBoxLayout (main)
â”œâ”€â”€ Time/Status Section (280px fixed)
â”œâ”€â”€ Carriers Section (expandable)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Carrier 1 Label (22px font)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Carrier 2 Label (22px font)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Carrier N Label (22px font)
â””â”€â”€ Acknowledgments Section (650px fixed)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Ack 1 Label (18px font)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Ack 2 Label (18px font)
    â””â”€â”€ Ack N Label (18px font)
```

## Data Structure (Unchanged)
The existing ack.json structure already supports individual acknowledgments:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-01-14",
    "manifest_time": "10:00",
    "carrier": "AUP International for NZ", 
    "user": "john.doe",
    "reason": "",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-14T10:05:30"
  }
]
```

## Testing
- âœ… Layout logic tested with mock data
- âœ… Acknowledgment key generation verified
- âœ… Color coding implementation confirmed
- âœ… Font size and width requirements met
- ðŸŸ¡ GUI testing pending (requires PyQt6 environment)

## Requirements Met
- [x] Individual acknowledgment labels per carrier line
- [x] Vertically aligned with carrier labels 
- [x] Acknowledgment labels slightly smaller font than carriers
- [x] 650 pixel wide acknowledgment section
- [x] Single line text (no wrapping)
- [x] Color coding for late acknowledgments
- [x] Existing data structure preserved
