## üéØ How the Manifest Alert System Works

### Basic Operation
The Manifest Alert System monitors scheduled manifest deliveries and provides visual and audio alerts when manifests become active or missed. The system automatically tracks acknowledgments across multiple computers for warehouse coordination.

### Alert Types
1. **üü¢ Open Manifests**: Scheduled but not yet active (green background)
2. **üî¥ Active Manifests**: Current time matches scheduled time (red background, audio alerts)
3. **üü† Missed Manifests**: Past due and unacknowledged (orange background, urgent alerts)

### Window Behavior
- **Always Visible**: Window stays on screen during alerts for maximum visibility
- **Auto-Sizing**: Automatically adjusts to fit all manifests
- **Monitor Switching**: "Switch Monitor" button cycles through all displays
- **System Tray**: Minimizes to system tray, click to restore

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System (config.json)

### File Location
The system uses **configurable data storage** via the Settings dialog:
- **Default**: `app_data/config.json` (local storage)
- **Network**: `\\server\share\manifest_data\config.json` (multi-PC sharing)
- **Cloud**: `G:\My Drive\manifest_data\config.json` (Google Drive Desktop sync)

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "manifests": [
    {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "time": "08:00",
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "carrier": "UPS",
      "time": "10:30",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Fields
- **`carrier`**: Display name for the manifest (e.g., "FedEx", "UPS Ground", "Amazon")
- **`time`**: Scheduled time in 24-hour format (e.g., "08:00", "14:30")
- **`active`**: Boolean - set to `false` to temporarily disable a manifest

### Adding/Editing Manifests
1. **Manual Editing**: Edit `config.json` directly with any text editor
2. **Reload Configuration**: Click "Reload Config" button to apply changes
3. **Validation**: System validates time format and displays errors if invalid

### Time Format Requirements
- **24-Hour Format**: Use "HH:MM" (e.g., "08:00", "14:30", "23:45")
- **Leading Zeros**: Always include leading zeros (e.g., "08:00" not "8:00")
- **Valid Times**: 00:00 to 23:59 only

## üìä Acknowledgment System (acknowledgments.json)

### File Purpose
Tracks which manifests have been acknowledged and by whom. Enables multi-PC coordination and accountability.

### File Location
Same configurable location as config.json:
- **Local**: `app_data/acknowledgments.json`
- **Shared**: User-configured network or cloud location

### Acknowledgment Structure
```json
[
  {
    "carrier": "FedEx",
    "time": "08:00",
    "acknowledged_by": "John Smith",
    "acknowledged_at": "2025-07-01T08:05:23",
    "reason": "Package delivered to receiving dock"
  }
]
```

### Acknowledgment Fields
- **`carrier`**: Matches the carrier name from config.json
- **`time`**: Matches the scheduled time from config.json
- **`acknowledged_by`**: User's custom name or Windows username
- **`acknowledged_at`**: Timestamp when acknowledgment was made
- **`reason`**: User-entered reason for acknowledgment (required)

### Acknowledgment Process
1. **Click Manifest**: Click any manifest entry in the list
2. **Enter Reason**: Type reason for acknowledgment (required field)
3. **Submit**: Click "Acknowledge" to save
4. **Immediate Update**: Manifest turns gray and shows "- Acknowledged - [Your Name]"
5. **Multi-PC Sync**: Other computers see acknowledgment within 0.5-2 seconds

## ‚è∞ Timing and Refresh System

### Alert Timing
- **Pre-Alert**: Manifests appear 30 minutes before scheduled time
- **Active Alert**: Audio and visual alerts start at exact scheduled time
- **Missed Alert**: Continues alerting until acknowledged if past due

### Refresh Rates (Adaptive System)
The system uses intelligent refresh timing for optimal performance:

#### Fast Refresh Mode (0.5 seconds)
**Triggers:**
- When any manifest becomes Active (red)
- When any manifest becomes Missed (orange)
- For 60 seconds after user acknowledgments

**Purpose:**
- Real-time multi-PC synchronization during critical periods
- Immediate visibility of acknowledgments across warehouse computers
- Ultra-responsive operation during active alerts

#### Normal Refresh Mode (2 seconds)
**Triggers:**
- When all manifests are Open (green) or acknowledged
- During idle periods with no active alerts
- System automatically switches from fast mode after alert resolution

**Purpose:**
- Resource-efficient operation during normal hours
- Preserves system performance for long-term 24/7 operation
- Maintains responsiveness while conserving CPU usage

### Multi-PC Synchronization
- **File Monitoring**: System detects changes to acknowledgments.json from other computers
- **Automatic Updates**: UI refreshes immediately when external changes detected
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last acknowledgment wins (no locking mechanism needed)
- **Network Compatibility**: Works with Windows network drives, Google Drive Desktop, and cloud storage

## üéôÔ∏è Audio Alert System

### Voice Announcements
Professional text-to-speech announcements using Windows Zira voice:

#### Announcement Patterns
- **Single Active**: "Manifest at eight thirty"
- **Single Missed**: "Manifest Missed, at eight thirty. Manifest is fifteen minutes Late"
- **Multiple Active**: "Multiple manifests Active. Please acknowledge"
- **Multiple Missed**: "Multiple missed manifests. Please acknowledge"
- **Mixed Status**: "Multiple Missed and Active Manifests. Please acknowledge"

#### Timing Behavior
- **Announcement Interval**: Every 20 seconds during active alerts
- **Smart Logic**: Prevents repetitive announcements with consolidated messages
- **Background Operation**: Non-blocking speech processing
- **Error Recovery**: Silent failure if speech engine unavailable

### Sound Alerts
- **Alert Sound**: Professional alert tone (alert.wav)
- **Timing**: Plays with each voice announcement
- **Volume**: Uses system volume settings
- **File Location**: `resources/alert.wav`

### Snooze Integration
Professional audio management during snooze periods:

#### Complete Audio Control
- **Voice Announcements**: Stopped immediately when snooze activated
- **Sound Alerts**: Stopped immediately when snooze activated
- **Speech Timer**: Paused during entire snooze period
- **Automatic Resume**: Both voice and sound alerts resume when snooze expires

#### Smart Audio Behavior
- **Unified Silence**: All audio systems respect snooze status
- **No Interruptions**: Zero audio during snooze period regardless of alert changes
- **Professional Operation**: Clean start/stop with no audio artifacts
- **Status Awareness**: Audio system automatically detects snooze state
