## üõ†Ô∏è Git Repository Cleanup Guide

### Current Status
- **Main Branch**: `Alert_and_UI_update` (current production code)
- **Recommended Action**: Merge to main and clean up old branches

### Step-by-Step Cleanup

#### 1. Merge Current Branch to Main
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge your current branch
git merge Alert_and_UI_update

# Push updated main
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Delete Old Remote Branches
```bash
# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Delete specific remote branches (replace branch-name with actual names)
git push origin --delete old-branch-name
git push origin --delete another-old-branch

# Example for common branch names:
git push origin --delete feature/initial-setup
git push origin --delete hotfix/bug-fixes
```

#### 3. Clean Up Local Branches
```bash
# List local branches
git branch

# Delete local branches
git branch -d old-branch-name
git branch -D force-delete-branch-name

# Clean up tracking references
git remote prune origin
```

#### 4. Set Main as Default Branch
```bash
# Ensure main is default locally
git checkout main

# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin main
```

### GitHub Web Interface Cleanup
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
3. Set `main` as the default branch
4. Go to **Branches** tab and delete old branches using the trash icon
