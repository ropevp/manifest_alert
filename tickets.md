## Ticket 1: Day-Change Logic (Auto-Reset at Midnight) ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Automatically reset the manifest list and acknowledgment log at midnight, so each day starts fresh without needing to restart the app.

**Acceptance Test:**
- At midnight (or by simulating a day change), the UI and acknowledgment log reset for the new day.
- No previous day's acknowledgments are shown.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Tested by simulating a day change; UI and log reset as expected.

---

## Ticket 2: System Tray Integration ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Add a system tray icon with menu options: Show/Hide Window, Exit. The app should minimize to tray and restore from tray.

**Acceptance Test:**
- Clicking the tray icon or menu shows/hides the main window.
- Exiting from the tray menu closes the app cleanly.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Tray integration works as expected with proper menu functionality.

---

## Ticket 3: Snooze/Silence Alerts ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Add a "Snooze" button to temporarily silence audible alerts and hide the window for a user-configurable duration (e.g., 1-5 minutes).

**Acceptance Test:**
- Clicking "Snooze" silences sound and hides the window for the selected duration.
- Alerts resume after snooze expires.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Snooze functionality implemented with configurable duration (1-30 minutes).

**Notes:**
- Window remains visible during snooze for warehouse TV display
- Sound and voice announcements are properly silenced
- Alerts resume automatically after snooze period

**Acceptance Test:**
- Clicking "Switch Monitor" moves the window to the next available screen.
- The window appears fully on the new screen.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Monitor switching cycles screens correctly and displays the window fully on each monitor.

## üéôÔ∏è NEW: Voice Announcement System ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Implement intelligent voice announcements using Windows text-to-speech for all manifest statuses.

**Features Implemented:**
- Professional Zira voice with optimal speech rate
- Smart announcement logic to prevent repetition
- Proper time pronunciation ("eleven thirty", "three oh three") 
- Pause handling for complex announcements
- Background threading for non-blocking operation

**Voice Patterns:**
- **Single Active**: "Manifest at [time]"
- **Single Missed**: "Manifest Missed, at [time]. Manifest is [X] minutes Late"
- **Multiple Active**: "Multiple manifests Active. Please acknowledge"
- **Multiple Missed**: "Multiple missed manifests. Please acknowledge"
- **Mixed**: "Multiple Missed and Active Manifests. Please acknowledge"

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All voice announcement patterns tested and verified working.

---

## üêõ BUG FIXES: Window Management ‚úÖ
**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Window Minimization Bug**: Missed acknowledgments were causing window to minimize
2. **Alert Priority Logic**: Active alerts now take priority over Missed for full-screen display

**Root Causes:**
- Inconsistent window state management in acknowledge_selected method
- Incorrect priority order in update_visual_alerts method

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added consistent window visibility code to all acknowledgment paths
- Changed priority from "Missed > Active > Open" to "Active > Missed > Open"
- Ensured window remains maximized after all acknowledgment types

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Window behavior now consistent across all acknowledgment scenarios.

## üìã TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE ‚úÖ
**Test Scripts Created:**
- `test_voice_announcements.py` - Comprehensive voice testing for all scenarios
- `test_live_voice.py` - Live application testing with configurable alert scenarios
- `VOICE_TESTING_REPORT.md` - Complete documentation of voice system

**Test Coverage:**

- Live integration testing
- Performance and reliability verification

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full test suite available for regression testing.

---

## Ticket 5: Always-on-Top Option ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Add a toggle to keep the alert window always on top of other windows.

**Acceptance Test:**
- When enabled, the window stays above all other windows.
- When disabled, normal stacking order resumes.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Always-on-top functionality implemented and working during alerts.

**Implementation Details:**
- Window automatically stays on top during Active/Missed alerts
- Uses Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint flag
- Integrated with alert lifecycle (enabled during alerts, normal stacking when idle)

---

## Ticket 6: Robust Error/Status Reporting ‚úÖ
**Description:**
Improve error dialogs and add a status bar for non-intrusive feedback (e.g., config reloads, log errors, etc.).

**Acceptance Test:**
- All errors are reported clearly, and non-critical info appears in the status bar.

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive error handling implemented.

**Implementation Details:**
- Robust acknowledgment logging with error dialogs
- Corrupted file backup and recovery
- Speech engine error handling (silent failures)
- Config reload notifications

## üöÄ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)

## Ticket 8: Shared Config and Log Storage (Network/Cloud/DB)
**Status:** Future Enhancement
**Description:**
Allow the application to use a shared config and log location (e.g., network folder, Google Drive, or central database) so multiple PCs (warehouse, manager) can access the same data.

**Acceptance Test:**
- The app can be pointed to a shared folder or DB and will read/write config and logs from there.
- Multiple PCs can see the same manifests and logs.

**Notes:**
- Start with a shared network folder or cloud drive for simplicity.
- Consider SQLite for robust multi-user logging if needed.
- Current JSON system works well for single-installation deployments

---

## Ticket 9: SQLite Log/Config Storage & Export  
**Status:** Future Enhancement
**Description:**
Replace JSON log/config with SQLite database for robust, scalable, and queryable storage. Support exporting historical log data to a file (CSV or JSON) for a user-selected date range.

**Acceptance Test:**
- All log and config data is stored in SQLite, not JSON.
- User can select a date range in the UI and export logs for that range.
- Exported file is named with the date range and incremental suffixes if needed.

**Notes:**
- Current JSON logging system is functional for warehouse deployment
- SQLite would provide better performance for high-volume logging
- Export functionality would enable historical analysis

---

## Ticket 10: UI Enhancements
**Status:** Future Enhancement  
**Description:**
Modern UI framework upgrade with enhanced visual design for warehouse environment.

**Potential Improvements:**
- CustomTkinter or PyQt6 upgrade for modern appearance
- Larger fonts optimized for warehouse viewing distances
- Enhanced color schemes and visual indicators
- Touch-friendly interface for tablet deployment

**Notes:**
- Current PyQt5 interface is fully functional and warehouse-ready
- Enhancements would be cosmetic rather than functional improvements
