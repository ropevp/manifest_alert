# Manifest Alerts V2 Rebuild Log

## Problem Summary
- Original issue: Window movement during acknowledgments in fullscreen/maximized modes
- Agent made multiple failed attempts to fix window state preservation
- Code became increasingly complex and broken
- Acknowledgment functionality completely non-functional
- Decision: Complete rebuild starting with clean tree UI

## V2 Rebuild Plan
1. **Strip back to basics**: Remove all snooze, complex window management, flashing
2. **Core tree functionality**: Simple manifest display with acknowledgment
3. **Clean acknowledgment flow**: No window movement, just data updates
4. **Add features incrementally**: Build up functionality piece by piece

## Rebuild Progress

### Step 1: Clean Tree UI (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Remove snooze system
- ✅ Remove flashing/background effects  
- ✅ Remove complex window state management
- ✅ Simple tree with manifest display
- ✅ Basic acknowledgment that just logs without UI disruption

**Changes Made:**
- Complete rewrite of alert_display.py (200 lines vs 1400+ before)
- Simple tree structure with time groups and carriers
- Color coding: Blue=Pending, Red=Active, Dark Red=Missed, Green=Acknowledged
- Clean acknowledgment flow: no window operations, just data logging
- Removed all snooze, flashing, speech, complex timers
- Basic 30-second refresh timer for tree updates

### Next Steps (Planned)
- Step 2: Basic acknowledgment without tree rebuild
- Step 3: Add visual status indicators (colors only)
- Step 4: Add audio alerts (simple)
- Step 5: Add window management (careful approach)
- Step 6: Add system tray (if needed)

## Key Principles for V2
- **No tree operations during acknowledgments in fullscreen/maximized**
- **Minimal UI updates - data changes only**
- **Test each feature before adding the next**
- **Keep acknowledgment flow completely separate from display updates**

## Session Log

### 2025-07-02 - Initial V2 Planning
- User frustrated with hours of failed attempts
- Decision to completely rebuild from clean foundation
- Starting with stripped-back tree UI

### 2025-07-02 - Clean V2 Created and Qt6 Upgraded
- ✅ Created completely new alert_display.py (220 lines vs 1400+)
- ⚠️ File became empty somehow - recreated clean version
- ✅ **UPGRADED TO PyQt6** for better performance and modern features
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt to use PyQt6
- ✅ Installed PyQt6 in virtual environment
- ✅ Application running successfully with Qt6

**V2 with Qt6 Features:**
- Modern Qt6 framework (better performance, newer APIs)
- Clean 220-line codebase vs 1400+ broken lines
- Simple tree structure with time groups and carriers
- Color coding: Blue=Pending, Red=Active, Dark Red=Missed, Green=Acknowledged
- Clean acknowledgment flow: no window operations, just data logging
- Removed all snooze, flashing, speech, complex timers
- Basic 30-second refresh timer for tree updates
- Fixed acknowledgment key lookup bug
