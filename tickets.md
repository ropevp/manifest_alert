4. **Diagnostic Tools**: Enhanced troubleshooting with venv detection

**Files Updated:**
- `launch_manifest_alerts_silent.bat` - Uses venv Python for silent launches
- `launch_manifest_alerts.bat` - Debug launcher with venv support
- `launch_diagnostic.bat` - Virtual environment status checking
- `install_shortcuts.py` - Creates shortcuts pointing to venv launchers

**Benefits Achieved:**

## Ticket 8: Shared Config and Log Storage (Network/Cloud/DB)
**Status:** Future Enhancement
**Description:**
Allow the application to use a shared config and log location (e.g., network folder, Google Drive, or central database) so multiple PCs (warehouse, manager) can access the same data.

**Acceptance Test:**
- The app can be pointed to a shared folder or DB and will read/write config and logs from there.
- Multiple PCs can see the same manifests and logs.

**Notes:**
- Start with a shared network folder or cloud drive for simplicity.
- Consider SQLite for robust multi-user logging if needed.
- Current JSON system works well for single-installation deployments

---

## Ticket 9: SQLite Log/Config Storage & Export  
**Status:** Future Enhancement
**Description:**
Replace JSON log/config with SQLite database for robust, scalable, and queryable storage. Support exporting historical log data to a file (CSV or JSON) for a user-selected date range.

**Acceptance Test:**
- All log and config data is stored in SQLite, not JSON.
- User can select a date range in the UI and export logs for that range.
- Exported file is named with the date range and incremental suffixes if needed.

**Notes:**
- Current JSON logging system is functional for warehouse deployment
- SQLite would provide better performance for high-volume logging

## üÜï NEW TICKET: Configurable Data Location Settings

## Ticket 11: Data Storage Location Configuration ‚è≥
**Status:** New Feature Request
**Priority:** High (Enables multi-PC and cloud deployments)

**Description:**
Add a settings interface to configure where the application stores its data files (`config.json` and `acknowledgments.json`). This enables flexible deployment options including local storage, network drives, and cloud synchronization via Google Drive Desktop.

**Feature Requirements:**
1. **Settings UI Access:**
   - Add settings icon/button in main application window
   - Accessible from system tray context menu
   - Clear visual indicator for settings access

2. **Folder Browser Interface:**
   - Native Windows folder selection dialog
   - Show current data location
   - Validate selected path is writable
   - Preview expected file locations

3. **Storage Location Options:**
   - **Local Storage**: `C:\manifest_data\` (default)
   - **Google Drive**: `G:\My Drive\manifest_data\` (via Google Drive Desktop)
   - **Network Drives**: `\\server\share\manifest_data\`
   - **Custom Paths**: Any user-specified Windows folder

4. **Settings Persistence:**
   - Store location preference in Windows registry or local settings file
   - Remember choice across application restarts
   - Fallback to default location if path becomes unavailable

5. **File Management:**
   - Automatically create folder structure if needed
   - Copy existing data files to new location on change
   - Validate required files exist in selected location
   - Create default files if missing

**Acceptance Test:**
- User can click settings icon to open folder browser
- Selected folder persists across application restarts
- Application correctly reads/writes to chosen location
- Works with local folders, network drives, and Google Drive Desktop paths
- Multiple PCs can share the same data location for synchronized operations

**Implementation Benefits:**
- **Multi-PC Deployment**: Multiple warehouse PCs sharing same config/logs
- **Cloud Backup**: Automatic backup via Google Drive Desktop synchronization
- **Centralized Management**: IT can update manifest schedules from any location
- **Data Portability**: Easy migration between systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Data preserved in cloud storage

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use `QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory()` for folder selection
- Store setting in `QSettings` (Windows registry) or `settings.json`
- Modify `data_manager.py` to use configurable paths
- Add path validation and error handling
- Support UNC paths for network drives
- Handle Google Drive Desktop sync conflicts gracefully

**Example Use Cases:**
1. **Warehouse Setup**: IT sets `G:\My Drive\manifest_data\` for cloud sync
2. **Multi-PC Operation**: All warehouse PCs point to same network folder
3. **Remote Management**: Manager updates schedules from office, syncs to warehouse
4. **Backup Strategy**: Critical data automatically backed up to Google Drive

## üÜï NEW TICKET: Real-Time Multi-PC Synchronization

## Ticket 12: Adaptive Refresh for Multi-PC Deployments ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** High (Enterprise multi-PC deployment critical)

**Description:**
Implement adaptive refresh rates to enable real-time synchronization of acknowledgments across multiple PCs accessing shared storage (Google Drive, network drives, etc.).

**Problem Solved:**
- Previously: All PCs refreshed acknowledgments every 30 seconds, causing up to 30-second delays before other users saw acknowledgments
- Solution: Dynamic refresh timing based on alert status for immediate multi-PC synchronization

**Implementation:**
1. **Adaptive Refresh Timing:**
   - **Fast Mode (5 seconds)**: During active/missed alerts for real-time sync
   - **Normal Mode (30 seconds)**: When no alerts active to preserve system resources
   - Automatic switching based on current alert status

2. **File Change Detection:**
   - Monitor `acknowledgments.json` modification timestamp
   - Detect changes made by other PCs accessing shared storage
   - Rebuild manifest list only when external changes detected
   - Silent failure handling to maintain system stability

3. **Immediate Response Triggers:**
   - When user acknowledges a manifest, immediately switch to fast refresh mode
   - Other PCs detect changes within 5 seconds instead of up to 30 seconds
   - Automatic return to normal refresh when alerts resolved

**Multi-PC Deployment Benefits:**
- **Real-Time Updates**: User acknowledgments appear on all PCs within 5-10 seconds
- **Resource Efficient**: Normal 30-second refresh when no alerts active
- **Enterprise Ready**: Supports Google Drive Desktop, network drives, shared folders
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic detection of shared storage scenarios

**Technical Details:**
- `update_refresh_timing()`: Dynamically adjusts timer intervals
- `check_acknowledgment_changes()`: File modification monitoring
- Preserves all existing functionality while adding multi-PC awareness
- Compatible with existing Google Drive/network drive deployments

**Status:**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Real-time multi-PC synchronization implemented and tested.
